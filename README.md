# Real-Time Transaction Monitoring & Fraud Detection Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time fraud detection system using modern data engineering and machine learning techniques. It processes banking transactions in real-time to detect suspicious activities and potential fraud cases.

## Architecture
- Data Ingestion Layer (Apache Kafka)
- Processing Layer (Apache Spark)
- Machine Learning Layer (Python, Scikit-learn)
- Alert & Monitoring Layer (FastAPI, Prometheus)

## Key Features
- Real-time transaction processing
- ML-based fraud detection
- Rule-based suspicious activity monitoring
- Alert generation and case management
- Performance monitoring and logging

## Setup Instructions
Detailed setup instructions will be added soon.
